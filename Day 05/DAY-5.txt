        Independence Day is celebrated annually on 15 August as 
        a public holiday in India commemorating the nation's 
        independence from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947, 
        the day when the provisions of the Indian Independence Act,
         which transferred legislative sovereignty to the 
         Indian Constituent Assembly, came into effect. 
         India retained King George VI as head of state until
          its transition to a republic, when the Constitution 
          of India came into effect on 26 January 1950
           (celebrated as Indian Republic Day) and 
           replaced the dominion prefix, Dominion of India, 
           with the enactment of the sovereign law 
           Constitution of India. India attained
            independence following the independence 
            movement noted for largely non-violent 
            resistance and civil disobedience led by
             Indian National Congress under the leadership 
             of Mahatma Gandhi.
