            A luxury car is a car that provides above-average to high-end levels of comfort, features, and equipment. Often more expensive materials and surface finishes are used, and buyers expect better build quality. The usually higher pricing and more upscale appearance is often associated with higher social status of the users, compared to low and mid-market segment cars.S
The term is relative and partially subjective, reflecting both objective qualities of a car, as well as the projected and perceived image of the car marque.[1] Luxury brands rank above premium brands, though there is no clear demarcation between the two.[2]
Traditionally, most luxury cars were large vehicles, though smaller sports-oriented models were always produced. "Compact" luxury vehicles such as hatchbacks, and off-road capable sport utility vehicles, are more recent expansions of luxury qualities in various cars.[1]
Increasing (comfort) features, materials quality, interior space, innovations, and or performance have consistently been competitive strategies between car makers, practically throughout the history of the automobile.

            The term "mustang" can refer to two different things. The first is a free-roaming horse of the Western United States, descended from horses brought to the Americas by the Spanish12. These horses are often referred to as wild horses, but because they are descended from once-domesticated animals, they are actually feral horses12. The second is a vehicle from the Ford brand, known as the Mustang34. The Mustang is a sports car that has been in production since the 1960s34. It comes with a variety of engine options and can be either a hard-shell coupe or a rag-top convertible4.

        Riding on large 23-inch wheels, Lanzador is a perfect blend of styling elements from Urus and Sián. With this new product, Lamborghini aims to create a whole new car segment called Ultra GT. Lanzador is being considered as a follow-up to the V12-powered plug-in hybrid Reveulto unveiled earlier this year. Contrary to notions, Lanzador isn’t Lamborghini’s first fully-electric concept to be unveiled globally, that honour belongs to the Terzo Millennio concept from 2017. Lanzador is the fourth model to be announced as part of Lamborghini’s Direzione Cor Tour strategy which pushes towards electrification.

        Automobiles Ettore Bugatti was a German then French manufacturer of high-performance automobiles. The company was founded in 1909 in the then-German city of Molsheim, Alsace, by the Italian-born industrial designer Ettore Bugatti. The cars were known for their design beauty and for their many race victories. Famous Bugatti automobiles include the Type 35 Grand Prix cars, the Type 41 "Royale", the Type 57 "Atlantic" and the Type 55 sports car.
        The death of Ettore Bugatti in 1947 proved to be a severe blow for the marque, and the death of his son Jean in 1939 meant that there was no successor to lead the factory. No more than about 8,000 cars were made. The company struggled financially, and it released one last model in the 1950s before eventually being purchased for its airplane parts business in 1963.
        In 1987, an Italian entrepreneur bought the brand name and revived it as Bugatti Automobili SpA.
