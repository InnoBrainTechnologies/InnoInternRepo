- **JavaScript:** Add interactivity and dynamic behavior to your websites.

- **Bootstrap:** Leverage a popular CSS framework for rapid and stylish web development.

### Attention, Interns!

To ensure smooth collaboration and organized development, please adhere to the following version control practices throughout this internship:

1. **Branching:** Each student must commit their work to **their own branch**. **DO NOT** commit directly to the `main` branch or any other student's branch.

2. **Branch Naming:** When creating your personal branch, use your **name or username** as a prefix. For example, `Yourname_rollno`.

3. **Commits:** Commit your work regularly and ensure each commit has a meaningful message describing the changes you made.

4. **Pull Requests:** When you're ready to merge your work, submit a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to `main`. A mentor will review your code before merging.

Adhering to these version control practices will help us maintain a clean and organized codebase, facilitate effective collaboration, and ensure that each intern's work is properly tracked.

### Let's Get Started!

We're excited to have you join us on this educational journey. Remember, learning is a hands-on process, so don't hesitate to ask questions, experiment, and explore. Embrace the challenges and successes that come your way – they're all part of your growth.

Get ready to unleash your creativity, ignite your passion for web development, and embark on an adventure that promises to expand your horizons.

Happy coding!

Best regards,
The Innobrain Technologies Team
