01) The HTML document includes a series of div elements with class "output-box" that
    contain placeholders for displaying the results of different JavaScript programs.

02) The JavaScript code manipulates arrays and performs various operations using these arrays.

03) Arrays are created and modified using different methods like directly assigning values,
    using the Array constructor, and various array methods.

04) The code demonstrates array manipulation methods such as and custom looping.

    •--> join 
    •--> toString
    •--> length
    •--> sort 
    •--> push 
    •--> pop 
    •--> shift 
    •--> unshift 
    •--> delete 
    •--> concat 
    •--> flat
    •--> splice 
    •--> slice    
    •--> reverse 

05) The code showcases different looping techniques, including the traditional `for` loop and the 'forEach` loop for arrays.

06) JavaScript objects and arrays of numbers are used to demonstrate different concepts.

07) The code employs HTML manipulation to display the results within the
    designated output boxes. Overall, the code provides a practical illustration of
    working with arrays in JavaScript and different methods to manipulate and modify them.
