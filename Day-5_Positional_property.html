        Independence Day is celebrated annually on 15 August as 
        a public holiday in India commemorating the nation's 
        independence from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947, 
        the day when the provisions of the Indian Independence Act,
        which transferred legislative sovereignty to the 
        Indian Constituent Assembly, came into effect. 
        India retained King George VI as head of state until
        its transition to a republic, when the Constitution 
        of India came into effect on 26 January 1950
        (celebrated as Indian Republic Day) and 
        replaced the dominion prefix, Dominion of India, 
        with the enactment of the sovereign law 
        Constitution of India. India attained
        independence following the independence 
        movement noted for largely non-violent 
        resistance and civil disobedience led by
        Indian National Congress under the leadership 
        of Mahatma Gandhi.
