    <h1>Informaation  about India</h1>
    <div>
        India is one of the strongest countries in the world. It is the seventh-largest country in the world area-wise and the second-most populous country in the world. India shares its borders with countries like Pakistan, Afghanistan, China, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar and Bangladesh. It also shares its borders with Sri Lanka and the Maldives. It is a secular and democratic country that respects all religions and the people of India have the liberty to practise any religion they want.

        India believes in nonviolence and therefore, Mahatma Gandhi is known as the father of the Nation because of his non-violent contribution to the freedom movement of the country. The tri-coloured national flag is known as Tiranga which has the Ashoka Chakra at the centre. The national emblem of the country is the ‘Lion Capital of Ashoka’.
        
        The Param Vir Chakra is India’s highest military decoration, given to those who have shown courage. Soldiers who put their lives on the line to safeguard residents are India’s heroes. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, often known as Pandit Nehru or Chacha Nehru, was India’s first prime minister. India is a land of many festivals, different dressing styles, and different food styles. People of different castes, creeds, and colours also live peacefully in India, and this is how it sets a perfect example of ‘Unity in Diversity’.
